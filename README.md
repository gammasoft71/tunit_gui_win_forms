# xtd.tunit.gui.forms

* xtd.tunit.gui.forms is a prototype written in C# to demonstrate the possibility of having a graphical interface for xtd.tunit.
* This project is not intended for the end user.
* It only serves as a base for a future product fully integrated with xtd and written with xtd.
* There are some bugs that linger and the functionality is not completely finished.
* But for a simple prototype, it's not bad.
